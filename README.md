# CodeLouPHP
Project Repo for Code Louisville PHP course


This is my project for the January-March 2017 Code Louisville PHP Track. 

I have traveled a lot in my life so far, so I am creating a Travelogue to record all of the places I've been and to write a little bit about my favorite places. I will also be able to keep track of all of the places I have yet to visit, and update the list as I go. 



Project Requirements:

Your project is responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes/resolutions

Must implement your core language (PHP or C#), build/use a database, and deployed in your respective framework (if C#, then ASP.NET; no framework is required for PHP)

Must implement CRUD functions - at minimum Read and Write to your database

You are welcome to use additional frameworks, packages, and other platforms along with your development. Don’t recreate the wheel, focus on solving a problem and bringing together all the things you’ve learned!

Your code has comments. Every line doesn’t need a comment, but at the very least large blocks of code you’ve written should have comments explaining what that block of code does. Auto-generated comments, such as those Visual Studio can create, do not count!

You are welcome to use frameworks, packages, and other platforms along with your development. Feel free to use Bootstrap to help on the front-end work, but you must still customize the look in some way. Or if you want a chat function, you can use an existing Node package so you don’t recreate the wheel.

It must include a README file providing the following:

A brief description of your project’s purpose and functionality (ex: “My Code Louisville PHP Project. A web app designed to let users create their own To-Do lists, add items to the lists, and mark them as complete.” Try to think of what would be useful to a potential employer that is looking at your GitHub account without any context
Detailed steps on how to start the application and any prerequisites needed by the user/reviewer. If the reviewer only needs to download, compile, and run the solution from Visual Studio, that is ok, but be sure to document that. If anything else is needed, (packages, frameworks, etc), be sure to list them. Just ensure anyone viewing your project will be able to figure out how to see it in action.
Your project code is on your GitHub account in its own repository. If you choose to host your application on a live URL, GREAT! You can share that for demonstration purposes or ease of running - and this is encouraged! But your code must still be available on GitHub for review.

Have fun! Your project should be something you're proud of, and that adequately demonstrates your base knowledge in the concepts you've learned.
